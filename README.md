A little file hosting script with an image gallery. ShareX JSON file included. 
I'm still working on getting it to be "amazing." At the moment it's in a sort of clusterfuck mode to me, but then again I'm really unconfident in my code so it could be good and i'm just bad.

| Server Requirements | Client Requirements |
| ------------------- | ------------------- |
| PHP 5.1             | Nothing             |
| Reasonable space    | ShareX (optional)   |
| ~512mb RAM          | Modern-ish browser  |

Features
--------
- Gallery with thumbnails
- Ability to migrate existing images and create new thumbnails
- Regular old file listing view
- No depencencies
- Will actually exist on my github
- JSON file for usage with ShareX
- Name means poop in japanese

Cons
----
- No BMP or TIFF thumbnail support
- Made by me

To do
-----
- Get to a point where I actually feel ok to release it
