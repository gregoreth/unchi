Hello! Welcome to Unchi, the brainchild of my 13 year old self. Named after the nihongo word for poop, and appropriately so, it's an extremely entry level solution for private file uploading- complete with a photo gallery and nothing else!

should work on PHP 5.3+, requires GD for thumbnail generation. although it's well overdue some housekeeping you';d probably wanna make the passkey use an actual cipher over sha512 for example. or just make a better one yourself
